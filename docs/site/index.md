# :material-home: What is Clan?

[Clan](https://clan.lol/) is a peer-to-peer computer management framework that
empowers you to reclaim control over your digital computing experience. Built on
NixOS, Clan provides a unified interface for managing networks of machines with
automated [secret management](./guides/secrets.md), secure [mesh VPN
connectivity](./guides/mesh-vpn.md), and customizable installation images. Whether
you're running a homelab or building decentralized computing infrastructure,
Clan simplifies configuration management while restoring your independence from
closed computing ecosystems.

At the heart of Clan are [Clan Services](./reference/clanServices/index.md) - the core
concept that enables you to add functionality across multiple machines in your
network. While Clan ships with essential core services, you can [create custom
services](./guides/clanServices.md) tailored to your specific needs.
