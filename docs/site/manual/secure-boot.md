At the moment, NixOS/Clan does not support [Secure Boot](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Secure_Boot). Therefore, you need to disable it in the BIOS. You can watch this [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKVShiMUePc) or follow the instructions below:

### Step 1: Insert the USB Stick
- Begin by inserting the USB stick into a USB port on your computer.

### Step 2: Access the UEFI/BIOS Menu
- Restart your computer.
- As your computer restarts, press the appropriate key to enter the UEFI/BIOS settings. 
??? tip "The key depends on your laptop or motherboard manufacturer. Click to see a reference list:"

    | Origin PC          | `F2`, `Delete`            |

    !!! Note
        Pressing the key quickly and repeatedly is sometimes necessary to access the UEFI/BIOS menu, as the window to enter this mode is brief.

### Step 3: Access Advanced Mode (Optional)
- If your UEFI/BIOS has a `Simple` or `Easy` mode interface, look for an option labeled `Advanced Mode` (often found in the lower right corner).
- Click on `Advanced Mode` to access more settings. This step is optional, as your boot settings might be available in the basic view.

### Step 4: Disable Secure Boot
- Locate the `Secure Boot` option in your UEFI/BIOS settings. This is typically found under a `Security` tab, `Boot` tab, or a similarly named section.
- Set the `Secure Boot` option to `Disabled`.

### Step 5: Change Boot Order
- Find the option to adjust the boot orderâ€”often labeled `Boot Order`, `Boot Sequence`, or `Boot Priority`.
- Ensure that your USB device is set as the first boot option. This allows your computer to boot from the USB stick.

### Step 6: Save and Exit
- Save your changes before exiting the UEFI/BIOS menu. Look for a `Save & Exit` option or press the corresponding function key (often `F10`).
- Your computer should now restart and boot from the USB stick.
