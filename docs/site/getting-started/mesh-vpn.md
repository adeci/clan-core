This guide provides detailed instructions for configuring
[ZeroTier VPN](https://zerotier.com) within Clan. Follow the
outlined steps to set up a machine as a VPN controller (`<CONTROLLER>`) and to
include a new machine into the VPN.

## Concept

By default all machines within one clan are connected via a chosen network technology.

```{.no-copy}
Clan
    Node A
    <-> (zerotier / mycelium / ...)
    Node B
```

If you select multiple network technologies at the same time. e.g. (zerotier + yggdrassil)
You must choose one of them as primary network and the machines are always connected via the primary network.

This guide shows you how to configure `zerotier` either through `NixOS Options` directly, or Clan's `Inventory` System.


=== "**Inventory**"
    ## 1. Choose the Controller

    The controller is the initial entrypoint for new machines into the vpn.
    It will sign the id's of new machines.
    Once id's are signed, the controller's continuous operation is not essential.
    A good controller choice is nevertheless a machine that can always be reached for updates - so that new peers can be added to the network.

    For the purpose of this guide we have two machines:

    - The `controller` machine, which will be the zerotier controller.
    - The `new_machine` machine, which is the machine we want to add to the vpn network.

    ## 2. Configure the Inventory
    ```nix
    clan.inventory = {
      services.zerotier.default = {
        roles.controller.machines = [
          "controller"
        ];
        roles.peer.machines = [
          "new_machine"
        ];
      };
    };
    ```
    
    ## 3. Apply the Configuration
    Update the `controller` machine:

    ```bash
    clan machines update controller
    ```


=== "**NixOS Options**"
    ## 1. Set-Up the VPN Controller

    The VPN controller is initially essential for providing configuration to new
    peers. Once addresses are allocated, the controller's continuous operation is not essential.

    1. **Designate a Machine**: Label a machine as the VPN controller in the clan,
       referred to as `<CONTROLLER>` henceforth in this guide.
    2. **Add Configuration**: Input the following configuration to the NixOS
       configuration of the controller machine:
       ```nix
       clan.core.networking.zerotier.controller = {
         enable = true;
         public = true;
       };
       ```
    3. **Update the Controller Machine**: Execute the following:
       ```bash
       clan machines update <CONTROLLER>
       ```
       Your machine is now operational as the VPN controller.

    ## 2. Add Machines to the VPN

    To introduce a new machine to the VPN, adhere to the following steps:

    1. **Update Configuration**: On the new machine, incorporate the following to its
       configuration, substituting `<CONTROLLER>` with the controller machine name:
       ```nix
       { config, ... }: {
         clan.core.networking.zerotier.networkId = builtins.readFile ../../vars/per-machine/<CONTROLLER>/zerotier/zerotier-network-id/value;
       }
       ```
    1. **Update the New Machine**: Execute:
       ```bash
       $ clan machines update <NEW_MACHINE>
       ```
       Replace `<NEW_MACHINE>` with the designated new machine name.

        !!! Note "For Private Networks"
            1. **Retrieve Zerotier Metadata**

                === "From the repo"
                    **Retrieve the ZeroTier IP**: In the clan repo, execute:
                     ```console
                     $ clan facts list <NEW_MACHINE> |  jq -r '.["zerotier-ip"]'
                     ```

                     The returned address is the Zerotier IP address of the machine.

                === "On the new machine"
                    **Retrieve the ZeroTier ID**: On the `new_machine`, execute:
                     ```bash
                     $ sudo zerotier-cli info
                     ```
                     Example Output:
                     ```{.console, .no-copy}
                     200 info d2c71971db 1.12.1 OFFLINE
                     ```
                     , where `d2c71971db` is the ZeroTier ID.


            2. **Authorize the New Machine on the Controller**: On the controller machine,
                 execute:

                === "with ZerotierIP"
                     ```bash
                     $ sudo zerotier-members allow --member-ip <IP>
                     ```
                     Substitute `<IP>` with the ZeroTier IP obtained previously.
                === "with ZerotierID"
                     ```bash
                     $ sudo zerotier-members allow <ID>
                     ```
                     Substitute `<ID>` with the ZeroTier ID obtained previously.

    2. **Verify Connection**: On the `new_machine`, re-execute:
       ```bash
       $ sudo zerotier-cli info
       ```
       The status should now be "ONLINE":
       ```{.console, .no-copy}
       200 info d2c71971db 1.12.1 ONLINE
       ```

!!! success "Congratulations!"
    The new machine is now part of the VPN, and the ZeroTier
    configuration on NixOS within the Clan project is complete.

## Further

Currently you can only use **Zerotier** as networking technology because this is the first network stack we aim to support.
In the future we plan to add additional network technologies like tinc, head/tailscale, yggdrassil and mycelium.

We chose zerotier because in our tests it was a straight forwards solution to bootstrap.
It allows you to selfhost a controller and the controller doesn't need to be globally reachable.
Which made it a good fit for starting the project.
