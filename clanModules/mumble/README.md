The mumble clan module gives you:

- True low latency voice communication.
- Secure, authenticated encryption.
- Free software.
- Backed by a large and active open-source community.

This all set up in a way that allows peer-to-peer hosting.
Every machine inside the clan can be a host for mumble, 
and thus it doesn't matter who in the network is online - as long as two people are online they are able to chat with each other.
