description = "Golem Provider for the Golem Network, an open-source and decentralized platform where everyone can use and share each other's computing power without relying on centralized entities like cloud computing corporations"
---

By running a golem provider your machine's compute resources are offered via the golem network which will allow other members to execute compute tasks on your machine. If this happens, you will be compensated with GLM, an ERC20 token.
